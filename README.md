# Wood Pyrolysis Modeling (SP-II Project)

This repository contains the modeling and optimization work on **Pyrolysis of Wood** carried out as part of the *Separation Processes-II (CL316)* course under the guidance of **Prof. Karthik Subramaniam Pushpavanam** at IIT Gandhinagar.  
The project focuses on **heat transfer, mass transport, and chemical kinetics modeling of biomass decomposition** using **COMSOL Multiphysics**, along with parameter estimation to validate against experimental data.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights
- Developed a **COMSOL Multiphysics model** coupling heat transfer, species transport, and chemical reactions for wood pyrolysis under inert conditions.  
- Conducted **parametric studies** on particle size, porosity, reaction kinetics, and ambient temperature.  
- Performed **parameter estimation via nonlinear optimization**, achieving close agreement with experimental temperature and mass-loss data.  
- Investigated key outputs: **temperature profiles, pressure & velocity fields, tar/gas concentration, and porosity evolution**.
